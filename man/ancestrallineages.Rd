\title{Extracts lineages leading to two tips, t1 and t2, from their most recent common ancestor.}
\usage{
ancestrallineages(phyl, phendata, t1, t2)
}
\arguments{
\item{phyl}{The phylogeny of interest in phylo format}

\item{phendata}{Phenotypic data for all tips}

\item{t1}{The first tip of interest}

\item{t2}{The second tip of interest}
}
\value{
A list containing two matrices.  Each matrix corresponds to a tip.  The matrix
consists of reconstructed ancestral values for all nodes leading from the mrca of both
tips to the tip.
