\title{Quantify convergence by the number of convergent events}
\usage{
convnum(
  phy,
  phendata,
  convtips,
  plot = TRUE,
  ellipse = NULL,
  plotellipse = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{phy}{The phylogeny of interest in phylo format}

\item{phendata}{Phenotypic data for all tips}

\item{convtips}{A list consisting of the names of all convergent taxa}

\item{plot}{Whether or not to plot a phylomorphospace with lineages that cross into the region of interest highlighted as red arrows.  Default=TRUE}

\item{ellipse}{Optional.  An ellipse defining the region of interest, into which groups may or may not converge.}

\item{plotellipse}{Optional.  The ellipse defining the region of interest in the first two dimensions.}
}
\value{
The number of lineages that have crossed into the region of trait space occupied by the convergent taxa.
}
\description{
This program takes in a set of taxa that are already suspected to be convergent in a particular area of  morphospace.  It then counts the number of times that a lineage has invaded that region of morphospace.
}
\details{
This function will construct an ellipse around all convergent taxa.  Then it will reconstruct ancestral states throughout the phylogeny, and use those to determine how many lineages have crossed into this ellipse from the outside.
