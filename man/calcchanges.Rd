\title{Calculates all phenotypic changes that occur on all branches of a phylogeny.}
\usage{
calcchanges(phyl, phendata)
}
\arguments{
\item{phyl}{The phylogeny of interest in phylo format}

\item{phendata}{A matrix of phenotypic data for all tips, with taxa in rows and characters in columns.}
}
\value{
A vector in which each element represents an edge of the phylogeny, and the values are the magnitudes of evolutionary change that occur along those edges.
}
\description{
Calculates the Euclidean distance between all ancestors and descendants on a phylogeny to reconstruct the phenotypic changes that occur along all edges of a phylogeny.
