#'Find the ancestor of a given node in a phylogeny
#'
#'This function will find the ancestor of a given node in a phylogeny.  It will return a two-element vector, which will contain both the node of the ancestor and the number of the edge that connects the node and ancestor.

#'@details   Returns a two-element vector.  The node of the ancestor is first;  the edge that connects that node with its ancestor is second.  
#'
#'@return A two-element vector, where the first element is the node of the ancestor and the second element is the number of the edge that connects the node and ancestor (i.e., the row number in phyl$edge).
